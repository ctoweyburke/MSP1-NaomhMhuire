-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The colours used are cornflower blue, white and black - to match the colours of the club crest. I included light gray - rather than white as I liked
            the way it blends in with the website, and it clearly defines the header and footer.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Montserrat font is the main font used for headings, with Roboto as second font throughout the whole website. Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. 
            Montserrat is a modern font, which I feel is attractive and used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate. Roboto was recommended in google fonts as a second font to use with Montserrat, and I 
            liked the look of it so that is why I chose it.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, hero image on the index.html page is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention as soon as they access the webpage.
             It also has an energetic aesthetically with the transition attached to it.
